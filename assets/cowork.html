    ## Introduction
    I recently got interested in natural language processing (NLP), especially large language models (LLMs), and created ðŸŽ¯SumUp, a web app that makes articles easier to understand. It leverages GPT-3 to generate summaries, AI-generated questions and answers, discussions, and action items to explore the topic further. Please give it a try and let me know what you think!
